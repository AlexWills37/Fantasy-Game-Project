# Fantasy-Game-Project
The first project for the C++ 2D Game Development course with Professor Roy.

Right now this version is for Programming Assignment 3.

## Usage
Run the command `make` to build the project.

Then run the file `./a.out` to run the game.

To play the game, use 'A' and 'D' to move left anf right, respectively. Try to avoid the fire!
If you touch the dragon's fire, you will lose health. When you reach 0 health, the game will end.
